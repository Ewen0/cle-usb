</p>

Benefits
========

* The phone can be used with any computer since any computer/os embeds keyboard drivers.

Limitations
===========

* An android phone with root access or a kernel compiled with a keyboard driver is required.
* A secure element is required (password based encryption could also be considered).

Status
======

The application is currently under development. Only the README and a [first version of the GUI](https://github.com/Ewen0/cle-usb-cljs) is available on github right now.
